# Online-job-portal-for-university-students

Problem statement:
There are plenty of reasons to despise the job-application process: It can be stressful, time consuming, discouraging, and awkward. But one of the biggest issues respondents say they have with the process is the lack of trust between job seekers and employers.
The present system requires applicants to search through emails and visual media for job opportunities. At current situation in the university, we are receiving job opportunities details via email. There is need of an online job portal where admin can accept/reject the company by analysing the details provided by the company, applicants easily find the jobs and employer can find suitable candidates for the job.
